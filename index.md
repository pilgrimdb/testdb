Welcome to the Pilgrim Routes database. These pages display overview information on and maps of modern walking routes to pilgrimage shrines in Europe. There is no hard and fast rule about what constitutes a 'route', but it's roughly defined as one where there is either waymarking or some sort of guide for walkers, preferably online. This means the many regular mass pilgrimages, such as Paris-Chartres or Warsaw-Czestochowa, are not included unless there is a published description of the route.

Nor is there any real rule on how a 'pilgrimage route' differs from any other walking route. In general, pilgrimage routes are based on historical medieval roads, and visit towns, especially those with a shrine or other religious connections, whereas walking routes are pleasant walks in the country. In practice, some of those claimed as 'pilgrim roads' are just rebranded existing long-distance paths and have little to do with pilgrimage.

Although the emphasis is on walking routes, many can also be used by cyclists, and even where a section is not really usable by cyclists it is generally easy for them to deviate onto a minor road going in the same direction.

The pages are all stored on [Github](https://github.com/pilgrimdb/pilgrimdb.github.io/), so anyone with an interest and time to spare can contribute by suggesting improvements, or adding new routes or map data. Each page has a link to the appropriate source on Github.
